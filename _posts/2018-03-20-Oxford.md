18 months ago I made the trip from down-to-earth east Yorkshire to the more rarified surroundings of Oxford. I didn’t think I’d stay here that long, but then I never do. I went to Switzerland for 6 months and stayed 15 years. Earlier in life I flitted around on short term assignments, rarely living in the same place longer than 3 or 6 months. Being older is one factor in dropping that lifestyle - what used to seem routine now requires huge effort. Especially relocating. Not just the logistics of it all, but the mental effort of adjusting to and learning how to work your new surroundings.

I've normally been stimulated by new environments. Stimulated to find out stuff, take photos, act the flaneur. Establish regular cafes and bars to watch the world go by.

Sadly, I haven't got those juices going in Oxford. Why? Maybe it's just old age slowdown. Maybe it's Oxford? I don't know. But I've decided to do something about it, and the start is writing down my thoughts. A return to blogging after a lengthy absence.
