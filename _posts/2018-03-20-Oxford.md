18 months ago I made the trip from down-to-earth east Yorkshire to the more rarified surroundings of Oxford. I didn’t think I’d stay that long, but then I never do. I went to Switzerland for 6 months and stayed 15 years. Earlier in life I flitted around on short term assignments, rarely living in the same place longer than 3 or 6 months. Being older is one factor in dropping that sort of lifestyle - what used to seem routine now requires huge effort. Especially relocating. Not just the logistics of it all, but the mental effort of adjusting to and learning how to work your new surroundings.
