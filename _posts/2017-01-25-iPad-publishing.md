I played with blogging about 12 years ago and it was fun, found me some friends I would have had no chance of meeting in normal circumstances.

However platforms like Blogger and Wordpress became clunky to use and slow! The fun of garnering followers and comments disappeared with the advent of dominant social media players, so I gave it up.

In the last few years though programs like Jekyll and Octopress along with advances in mobile technologies have re-invigorated the self-publishing ecosphere with simple text based markup, fast static pages, and slick mobile interfaces.

This was written and published using these technologies, and over the space of a few posts I'm going to explain how it all works for me.
