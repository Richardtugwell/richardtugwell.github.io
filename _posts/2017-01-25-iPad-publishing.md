I played with blogging about 10 years ago and it was fun, found me some friends that I would have had no chance of meeting in normal circumstances.

I'm now returning to blogging but for different reasons. I'm a software developer and intrigued by how technology and gadgets are changing how we accomplish things and enable us to do things in a way that was not possible previously.

Take blogging, or web publishing for example. It used to be that you used an interface connected to back end services and a database. Something like Blogger or Wordpress. There are problems with these types of programs though - they're slow, and importantly the web interfaces made mobile blogging a bit of a PITA.
