title: Mobile Blogging Workflow

When I last played with blogging about 10 years ago, mobile wasn't really an option, and I eventually got fed up with bloated inconvenient packages like Blogger and Wordpress. In the last few years this has changed completely though, so I'm giving it another try.

Here's a brief overview of the workflow and technologies I've adopted. I'm doing most of this on a 9.7" iPad Pro with the smart keyboard. More about this later.

**Jekyll** - static website generator. Not especially a mobile option, but static sites are the way to go for a fast responsive experience and are an obvious fit for mobile consumers. In addition clean coding with Markdown and the DB / platform agnosticism appeal to the geek in me.

**Github Pages** - There are many ways to host a static website pretty much for nothing. I've picked Github Pages for ease of deployment and because I'm already a Github user.

**Editorial** - A lightweight markdown editor with Github integration. THis is what I use for editing on the iPad.

TBC.
