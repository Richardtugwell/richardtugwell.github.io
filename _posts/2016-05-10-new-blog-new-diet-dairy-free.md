I have a good diet - balanced nutrition, fresh food, modest quantities. On the other hand I'm badly overweight - mostly due to beer consumption. So why a new diet? Why not just cut out the beer? Ha! That's a story for another day, because this post is not about personal health, it's about balancing consumption with ethical and environmental concerns about how we run the planet.
