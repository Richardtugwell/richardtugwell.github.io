The site is written predominantly on a 9.7" iPad Pro with the Apple Smart Keyboard. It's an attempt to justify a mobile-only workflow.

Content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
 
> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). 
 
For editing I use [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/), a superficially minimalist text editor with powerful features and extensibility if you want it.

The site is published using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - probably the de facto standard for static websites these days - amd is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

(This site is built with Lanyon)
